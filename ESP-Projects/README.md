# File Organization

All application exercises can be kept in "ESP-Examples".

- To work through a new exercise, create a new .c file in the main directory
- To switch the file you want to build, flash, and run,
  change the "SRCS" in "/ESP-Projects/main/CMakeLists.txt" to only contain one file with app_main() with that being your target

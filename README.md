# ESP32S3_25-26

Embedded applications running on the ESP32S3 for the 2025-2026 year.

Each group should create a branch with the following naming convention: GroupX_StudentName
Each group can have multiple branches if needed.

For example, if you are in group 3 (on Clickup) and your name is Jayrady, name your branch Group3_Jayrady.

All application exercises can be kept in "ESP-Examples".

- To work through a new exercise, create a new .c file in the main directory
- To switch the file you want to build, flash, and run,
  change the "SRCS" in "/ESP-Projects/main/CMakeLists.txt" to only contain one file with app_main() with that being your target
